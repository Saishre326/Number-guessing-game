Hello ! I have done a mini project on Number guessing game .
Using html, css and script .
It is a game to guess the right number .
The number is between 0 to 100 .
If you choose the right number it'll show "congratulation ! you guessed it ." 
If the number is high then it'll show "Too high ! Try again ."
If the number is low then it'll show "Too low ! Try agian ."
